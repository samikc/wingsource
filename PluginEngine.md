The **_Plugin Engine_** is created to evaluate a S-Expression. It is intended that we will evaluate an S-Expression in the following simple way:

```
   (_operator_ operand1 operand2 (_operator_ operand1 ...) ... )
```

Here one can define an operator and how it behaves based on the need of the developer. There is not a single operator enforced. This will provide an interesting starting point for all of us. We can now define anything that want the _s-exp_ to be.

This is as of now incomplete so please wait for more on this. Soon you will have an example (or two).
